# Supplementary Material Accompanying the Study “Preparing Acoustic Pitch Data for Computational Analysis and Presentation” by van Dam (2024)

This repository provides access to sample data and code discussed in the study “Preparing Acoustic Pitch Data for Computational Analysis and Presentation” (van Dam 2024, DOI 10.15475/calcip.2024.2.4). For details, see the description in the study, to quickly run the code shown here, please follow the following steps:

- Install the dependencies in requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `python run.py`, which will create a plot based on the pitch data in the `data` subfolder.

If you use the data and code shown here in your work, please cite the original study:
